    "Overlap of Class Decorators with Metaclasses for Handling Classes:\n",
    "Class decorators and metaclasses can both be used for modifying or augmenting class definitions. Class decorators are functions that take a class as an argument and return a new class, often with some modifications. They are applied using the @decorator_name syntax before the class definition. While metaclasses operate at a lower level, allowing more extensive manipulation of class creation and behavior. Both techniques can achieve similar results, but metaclasses offer more power and control over class construction and behavior."

On the other hand, metaclasses control the creation of instances as well as the behavior of classes.

While class decorators and metaclasses can overlap in their effects on class behavior, metaclasses have a broader scope and can directly influence instance creation and behavior.\n",
