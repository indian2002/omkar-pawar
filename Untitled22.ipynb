    "Q1: What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "Answer: Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming languages where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. In other words, a class can be derived from more than one base classes, and it inherits features from all of them.\n",

    "Q2: What is the concept of delegation?\n",

    "Q5: What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?\n",
    "Answer: Pseudoprivate attributes in Python are created by adding double underscores before the attribute name (e.g., __private_attribute). These attributes are not truly private but are name-mangled to avoid accidental name clashes between attributes in different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes is to make it less likely that a subclass will accidentally override an attribute in a base class. It provides a way to create attributes with a unique name within the class, reducing the chance of naming conflicts in large projects with multiple developers.\n",
