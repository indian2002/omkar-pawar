    "1. **Difference Between Greedy and Non-greedy Syntax:**\n",
    "   - Greedy: Matches as much as possible while still allowing the overall pattern to match.\n",
    "   - Non-greedy: Matches as little as possible while still allowing the overall pattern to match.\n",
    "   - Transformation: Change quantifiers (+, *, ?, {}) to their non-greedy counterparts by adding a '?' after them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **When Greedy vs. Non-greedy Makes a Difference:**\n",
    "   - Difference: Affects the number of characters matched by a pattern, especially when used with quantifiers like *, +, or ?. \n",
    "   - Non-greedy Match: If only a greedy match is available, it may match more characters than intended, potentially altering program results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use of Non-tagged Group in Simple String Match:**\n",
    "   - Practical Difference: In a simple match without replacement, a non-tagged group doesn't make a significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scenario Impact of Non-tagged Category:**\n",
    "   - Impact: When extracting substrings based on patterns, using non-tagged categories can affect the selection and grouping of matched portions, leading to different program outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Impact of Look-ahead Condition on Program Results:**\n",
    "   - Difference: In scenarios where you need to check for a pattern without consuming characters, look-ahead conditions are crucial for accurate results, especially when matching overlapping patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Difference Between Positive and Negative Look-ahead:**\n",
    "   - Positive Look-ahead: Asserts that a pattern must be followed by another pattern.\n",
    "   - Negative Look-ahead: Asserts that a pattern must not be followed by another pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Benefit of Referring to Groups by Name:**\n",
    "   - Benefit: Enhances code readability and maintainability, making it easier to understand the purpose of each group within a regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Identifying Repeated Items Using Named Groups:**\n",
    "   - Example: By using named groups, you can capture repeated items within a target string, such as finding all occurrences of the same word.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Difference Between Scanner Interface and re.findall:**\n",
    "   - Scanner Interface: Provides more control over parsing by allowing iteration over tokens one at a time, which re.findall does not offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Naming Convention for Scanner Objects:**\n",
    "    - No Requirement: A scanner object does not have to be named \"scanner\"; any valid identifier can be used."
