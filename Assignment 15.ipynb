    "1. **New Features in Python 3.8:**\n",
    "   Python 3.8 introduced several new features and improvements, including:\n",
    "   - Assignment expressions (`:=` operator)\n",
    "   - Positional-only parameters in function definitions\n",
    "   - f-strings support the `=` specifier for self-documenting expressions\n",
    "   - Syntax for TypedDict\n",
    "   - Performance improvements in various areas\n",
    "   - New modules and libraries, such as `importlib.metadata` for reading metadata from installed packages\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monkey Patching in Python:**\n",
    "   Monkey patching refers to the practice of dynamically modifying or extending the behavior of modules, classes, or functions at runtime. It involves altering the code of existing objects or functions during program execution to change their behavior or add new functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Difference Between Shallow Copy and Deep Copy:**\n",
    "   - **Shallow Copy:** A shallow copy creates a new object but inserts references to the original nested objects into it. Changes made to the nested objects in the copy will affect the original objects, and vice versa.\n",
    "   - **Deep Copy:** A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies the nested objects within it. Changes made to the nested objects in the copy will not affect the original objects, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maximum Possible Length of an Identifier:**\n",
    "   In Python, the maximum possible length of an identifier (variable name, function name, etc.) is implementation-dependent. However, Python's internal limit for identifiers is typically 255 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generator Comprehension:**\n",
    "   Generator comprehension, also known as generator expression, is a concise way to create generator objects in Python. It follows the syntax of list comprehension but produces generator objects instead of lists. Generator comprehensions are surrounded by parentheses and evaluate lazily, generating values on-the-fly as they are needed, which can save memory compared to creating a full list. Example:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   gen = (x ** 2 for x in range(10))  # Generator comprehension\n",
    "   ```"
