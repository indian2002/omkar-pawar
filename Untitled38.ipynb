    "Q1. **Probability Distribution:**\n",
    "   - A probability distribution is a mathematical function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes in a sample space of a random phenomenon. It provides a systematic way to assign probabilities to different events or values.\n",
    "   - While the individual values may be random and unpredictable, a probability distribution describes the overall pattern or behavior of these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **True Random vs Pseudo-Random Numbers:**\n",
    "   - True random numbers are generated from physical processes believed to be truly random, such as atmospheric noise or radioactive decay. They are unpredictable and non-reproducible.\n",
    "   - Pseudo-random numbers, on the other hand, are generated using deterministic algorithms. While they appear random, they are generated from a seed value, making them reproducible given the same seed.\n",
    "   - Pseudo-random numbers are considered \"good enough\" for many applications because they exhibit statistical properties similar to true random numbers and are efficient to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Factors Influencing Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "   - The two main factors influencing the behavior of a normal probability distribution are the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ).\n",
    "   - The mean determines the central tendency or average of the distribution, while the standard deviation measures the dispersion or spread of the values around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Real-life Example of Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "   - Heights of adult humans are often cited as an example of a normal distribution. In a large population, heights tend to cluster around the average height, with relatively few individuals being significantly taller or shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Short Term vs Long Term Behavior of Probability Distribution:**\n",
    "   - In the short term, the behavior of a probability distribution may exhibit randomness or variability.\n",
    "   - However, as the number of trials or observations grows, the distribution tends to converge to its theoretical or expected shape, following the laws of probability and becoming more predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Objects Shuffled by random.shuffle:**\n",
    "   - The `random.shuffle()` function can shuffle sequences like lists or arrays. It rearranges the elements of the sequence randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **Categories of Functions in the math Package:**\n",
    "   - The math package in Python generally includes functions related to mathematical operations, such as arithmetic functions, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, exponential functions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. **Relationship between Exponentiation and Logarithms:**\n",
    "   - Exponentiation and logarithms are inverse operations of each other. If \\(a^b = c\\), then \\(\\log_a(c) = b\\). Logarithms essentially answer the question \"to what power must I raise the base to get the argument?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. **Logarithmic Functions Supported by Python:**\n",
    "   - Python supports three logarithmic functions:\n",
    "     1. `math.log(x)`: Natural logarithm (base \\(e\\)) of \\(x\\).\n",
    "     2. `math.log10(x)`: Base-10 logarithm of \\(x\\).\n",
    "     3. `math.log2(x)`: Base-2 logarithm of \\(x\\)."
