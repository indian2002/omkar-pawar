    "1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "An abstract superclass, in the context of object-oriented programming, is a class that is designed to be inherited by other classes rather than instantiated on its own. It often contains abstract methods, which are methods without a concrete implementation in the superclass. Subclasses are then required to provide their own implementation for these abstract methods. Abstract superclasses are used to define a common interface or behavior that should be shared among multiple related classes."

    "2. What happens when a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "When a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement, it creates a class variable rather than an instance variable. Class variables are shared among all instances of the class, and modifying the value of a class variable affects all instances of that class. Instance variables, on the other hand, are specific to each instance of the class."

    "Answer:\n",
    "In Python, when a subclass has its own __init__ method, it needs to explicitly call the __init__ method of its superclass if the superclass has an __init__ method that initializes essential attributes. This ensures that both the subclass's and the superclass's initialization code is executed.\n",

    "Answer:\n",

    "\n",
