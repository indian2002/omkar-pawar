    "Q1. To increase the comparison between different figures on the same graph, you can consider several options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjusting the scaling of the axes to provide a clearer view of the data range.\n",
    "- Using different colors or patterns for each figure to enhance visual distinction.\n",
    "- Adding annotations or labels to highlight key points or trends.\n",
    "- Utilizing secondary axes for additional data sets, if applicable.\n",
    "- Employing small multiples or facetting to display subsets of the data separately for easier comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Compound interest offers the benefit of exponential growth over time compared to simple interest or higher rates that do not compound. With compound interest, the interest earned in each period is added to the principal amount, and subsequent interest calculations are based on the new, larger principal. This leads to the growth of the investment accelerating over time. In contrast, a higher rate of simple interest that does not compound would result in linear growth, where the interest remains constant each period and is not reinvested to generate additional returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. It consists of bars that represent the frequency or relative frequency of data points falling within specific intervals or bins. In Python's NumPy library, you can create a histogram using the `numpy.histogram()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. To change the aspect ratios between the X and Y axes in a plot, you can use the `plt.axes().set_aspect()` function in Matplotlib. You can specify the aspect ratio as a parameter to this function, allowing you to adjust the ratio between the lengths of the axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. The three types of array multiplication between two NumPy arrays are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dot product: Calculated using `numpy.dot()` or the `@` operator. It results in a scalar or a 1D array.\n",
    "- Outer product: Obtained using `numpy.outer()`. It generates a matrix where each element is the product of elements from the two input arrays.\n",
    "- Regular multiplication: Simply using the `*` operator. It performs element-wise multiplication, resulting in a new array where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in the input arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. To measure your monthly mortgage payment before buying a home, you might use the numpy function `numpy.pmt()`, which calculates the monthly payment for a loan based on constant payments and a constant interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Yes, string data can be stored in NumPy arrays, but there are limitations. One major restriction is that all elements in a NumPy array must have the same data type. Therefore, if you store string data in a NumPy array, it will convert all elements to a string data type, potentially resulting in loss of information or unexpected behavior if the array contains numerical data as well."
