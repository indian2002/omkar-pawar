    "Q1. Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module in Python. The goal of doing this could be to provide different names for the module within your code, making it more readable or avoiding naming conflicts. For instance, you might import the same module twice with different names if you're using different parts of the module extensively in your code and want to make it clearer which part you're referring to in each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Some characteristics of a module in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation: Modules allow you to encapsulate related functions, classes, and variables, providing a logical organization for your code.\n",
    "- Reusability: Modules can be reused in multiple programs, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.\n",
    "- Namespace: Modules create their own namespace, preventing naming collisions and providing a way to organize and access symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. To avoid circular importing and its associated problems, you can refactor your code to remove mutual dependencies between modules. One common approach is to move shared functionality into a separate module that both modules can import without creating a circular dependency. Alternatively, you can reorganize your code to reduce inter-module dependencies or use techniques like lazy loading or dependency injection to delay importing until necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. The `__all__` attribute in Python is used to specify a list of public symbols (functions, classes, variables) that should be imported when using the `from module import *` syntax. It allows module authors to control which symbols are considered part of the module's public API and should be accessible to users of the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. It is useful to refer to the `__name__` attribute or the string `'__main__'` when you want to determine whether a Python script is being run as the main program or being imported as a module into another script. This distinction allows you to write code that behaves differently depending on how it is being executed, such as running a set of test cases when the script is run directly but not when it's imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Some benefits of attaching a program counter to the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) interpreter application include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tracking the current position in the RPN script, making it easier to handle control flow constructs like loops and conditional statements.\n",
    "- Facilitating error handling and debugging by providing information about the location of errors or exceptions within the script.\n",
    "- Enabling features like stepping through the script line by line for interactive debugging or visualization purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. To render a basic programming language like RPN primitive but complete, you would need at least the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stack data structure implementation for operand storage and manipulation.\n",
    "- Parsing mechanism to tokenize input expressions into operands and operators.\n",
    "- Evaluation logic to interpret the RPN expressions and perform operations according to the operators.\n",
    "- Error handling mechanisms to detect and handle syntax errors, stack underflows/overflows, and other potential issues.\n",
    "- Optionally, you might also include support for variables, functions, conditional statements, and loops to enhance the language's expressiveness and usefulness."
