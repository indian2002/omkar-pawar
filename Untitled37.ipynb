    "1. **Float vs Decimal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Float Class:**\n",
    "        - **Benefits:** Floats are built-in data types in Python, providing fast and efficient representation of real numbers.\n",
    "        - **Drawbacks:** Limited precision and potential for rounding errors due to binary representation. Precision can be lost during arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Decimal Class:**\n",
    "        - **Benefits:** Decimal class from the `decimal` module offers arbitrary precision decimal arithmetic. It's suitable for applications requiring high precision, such as financial calculations, where exact representation is crucial.\n",
    "        - **Drawbacks:** Slower performance compared to floats, as Decimal arithmetic involves more computational overhead. Additionally, it requires explicit instantiation and operations may not be as intuitive as with floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identity of Decimal Objects:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - `Decimal('1.200')` and `Decimal('1.2')` are two different objects in memory.\n",
    "    - They represent the exact same value but may have different internal representations due to trailing zeroes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Equality Check:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - If the equality of `Decimal('1.200')` and `Decimal('1.2')` is checked, they will be considered equal since the comparison is based on their values, not their internal representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Starting with a String:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - It is preferable to start a Decimal object with a string rather than a floating-point value to avoid any potential inaccuracies introduced by floating-point representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Combining Decimal with Integers:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - Combining Decimal objects with integers is straightforward and preserves precision, as both Decimal and integers support arbitrary precision arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Combining Decimal with Floats:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - While Decimal objects and floating-point values can be combined, it's important to note that the floating-point value will be converted to a Decimal, potentially losing precision due to the limitations of floating-point representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Quantity with Absolute Precision using Fraction:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - An example using the Fraction class to express a quantity with absolute precision would be `Fraction(3, 5)`, representing the exact fraction 3/5 without any loss of precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Quantity not accurately expressed by Floats:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - An example would be representing 1/3. While Decimal or Fraction classes can represent 1/3 exactly, floating-point representation would lead to rounding errors and loss of precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Internal State of Fraction Objects:**\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - The internal state of `Fraction(1, 2)` and `Fraction(5, 10)` is the same since both represent the fraction 1/2. Fraction objects automatically reduce fractions to their simplest form.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Relation between Fraction and Integer:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The Fraction class allows for precise representation of rational numbers, including integers. Integers can be treated as fractions with a denominator of 1, and Fraction objects can be instantiated directly from integers."
