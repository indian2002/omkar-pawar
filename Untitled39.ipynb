    "Q1. **Benefits of the built-in array package:**\n",
    "   - The built-in array package provides a more memory-efficient way to store data compared to standard Python lists, as arrays store homogeneous data types.\n",
    "   - Arrays offer efficient storage and manipulation of numerical data, making them suitable for mathematical computations and numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **Limitations of the array package:**\n",
    "   - Arrays are limited to storing elements of a single data type, unlike lists which can store heterogeneous data types.\n",
    "   - Arrays have a fixed size upon creation and cannot dynamically resize like lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Differences between array and numpy packages:**\n",
    "   - The `array` package is built-in to Python and provides basic array functionality for storing and manipulating homogeneous data.\n",
    "   - `numpy` is a third-party library that extends array functionality significantly, offering advanced mathematical functions, multidimensional arrays, and optimized performance for numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Distinctions between empty, ones, and zeros functions:**\n",
    "   - `empty`: Creates an array without initializing its values. The contents of the array are unpredictable and depend on the state of memory.\n",
    "   - `ones`: Creates an array filled with ones.\n",
    "   - `zeros`: Creates an array filled with zeros.\n",
    "   - The primary difference lies in the initial values of the arrays created by these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Role of the callable argument in fromfunction function:**\n",
    "   - The `fromfunction` function is used to construct new arrays by applying a function to each coordinate of the array.\n",
    "   - The callable argument represents the function that is applied to generate values for each element of the new array based on its coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Combining numpy array with a single-value operand:**\n",
    "   - When a numpy array is combined with a single-value operand through addition, the scalar value is broadcasted to match the shape of the array, and the addition operation is applied element-wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **Array-to-scalar operations with combined operation-assign operators:**\n",
    "   - Yes, array-to-scalar operations can use combined operation-assign operators like `+=` or `*=`. The outcome is the same as applying the operation directly to each element of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. **Fixed-length strings in numpy arrays:**\n",
    "   - Yes, numpy arrays can contain fixed-length strings using the `dtype` parameter.\n",
    "   - If you allocate a longer string to one of these arrays, the extra characters beyond the specified length will be truncated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. **Combining two numpy arrays using operations like addition or multiplication:**\n",
    "   - When combining two numpy arrays using operations like addition or multiplication, the operation is applied element-wise.\n",
    "   - The conditions for combining two numpy arrays are that they must have compatible shapes, meaning they should have the same dimensions or be broadcastable to the same shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. **Using a Boolean array to mask another array:**\n",
    "   - The best way to use a Boolean array to mask another array is by indexing the array with the Boolean mask.\n",
    "   - For example: `masked_array = original_array[boolean_mask]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. **Ways to get the standard deviation of data:**\n",
    "   1. **Using numpy**: `numpy.std(data)`\n",
    "   2. **Using statistics module in Python**: `statistics.stdev(data)`\n",
    "   3. **Using pandas**: `pandas.Series(data).std()`\n",
    "   - The fastest way would generally be using numpy, as it is highly optimized for numerical computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. **Dimensionality of a Boolean mask-generated array:**\n",
    "   - The dimensionality of a Boolean mask-generated array depends on the shape of the original array and the condition specified by the mask. If the mask is applied to a multi-dimensional array, the resulting array will retain the same number of dimensions as the original array. However, dimensions corresponding to False values in the mask may be collapsed."
