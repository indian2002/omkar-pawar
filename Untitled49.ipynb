    "1. TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning library known for its flexibility, scalability, and comprehensive ecosystem. Other popular deep learning libraries include PyTorch, Keras, Caffe, MXNet, and Theano.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. TensorFlow can serve as a drop-in replacement for NumPy in many cases, offering similar functionalities with added benefits for deep learning tasks. However, TensorFlow operates with computational graphs, enabling distributed computing and optimization for GPU/TPU, while NumPy is primarily focused on numerical computations and lacks these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. No, you do not get the same result with `tf.range(10)` and `tf.constant(np.arange(10))` because the former returns a TensorFlow tensor, while the latter returns a NumPy array. However, they would contain the same values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Six other data structures available in TensorFlow beyond regular tensors include SparseTensor, RaggedTensor, TensorArray, Dataset, FeatureColumn, and QueueRunner.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You would use writing a function for defining a custom loss function when the loss computation involves simple operations, whereas subclassing the `keras.losses.Loss` class is preferable for more complex losses requiring additional stateful computations or custom behavior.\n",

    "\n",
    "9. Custom Keras components can contain arbitrary Python code, but they must be convertible to TF Functions for performance optimization and compatibility with TensorFlow's graph execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. To make a function convertible to a TF Function, you should avoid using Python features like loops or conditionals, ensure that all operations are TensorFlow operations (or can be wrapped with `tf.py_function`), and avoid using unsupported data types or operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. You would need to create a dynamic Keras model when the architecture or flow of your model depends on runtime conditions or inputs, such as sequence models with variable lengths. You can achieve this by using Keras Functional API with conditional statements or loops. However, creating dynamic models might lead to performance overhead and can be less optimized compared to static models."
