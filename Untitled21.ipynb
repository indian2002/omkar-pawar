    "Q1: Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "Answer: To support iteration in your classes, you can implement the __iter__ and __next__ methods. The __iter__ method returns the iterator object itself, and the __next__ method returns the next value from the iterator."

    "\n",
