    "Resource Management: Exceptions can be used to manage resources such as files, network connections, or database connections. By catching exceptions, you can ensure proper cleanup and release of resources even if an error occurs.\n",

If the exception is still not handled at the top level, the program will terminate, and an error message will be displayed, indicating the type of exception and the traceback."
